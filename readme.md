# Swinging Leaf Animation

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates a swinging leaf animation in the console.

## Usage

Just run the `index.js` file using Node.js to see the swinging leaf animation in your console.

```bash
node index.js

Description
The program generates a leaf emoji üçÉ and makes it swing from side to side within a certain range of motion. It creates a random offset for each swing, providing a natural and organic movement to the leaf. The animation continuously loops with a specified speed.

Customization
You can customize the animation by adjusting the following parameters in the index.js file:

maxOffset: Maximum offset the leaf can swing from its central position.
swaySpeed: Speed of the swinging animation in milliseconds.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters to achieve your desired animation effects!
